*Hello Julia, what trends do you see in how businesses are approaching Learning & Development (L&D) today and where do you think the industry is headed?*


*Hello Julia, what trends do you see in how businesses are approaching Learning & Development (L&D) today and where do you think the industry is headed?*

– I see three particularly clear trends in L&D right now. First and foremost, I notice a growing emphasis on lifelong learning. In a time of rapid technological and job market changes, lifelong learning becomes increasingly crucial for adapting to the ever-new challenges and opportunities that constantly arise. More organizations are becoming aware of the importance of lifelong learning and are actively working to develop their learning culture and learning structures.

– Additionally, I see an increased demand from L&D teams themselves to have space to work more strategically in their roles. As it becomes increasingly business-critical to ensure the right skills, organizations have much to gain by allowing those with expertise in learning and development to shift from taking orders to being more proactive and contributing by analyzing the organization's skills needs and being included in how skill development can be part of the organization's strategy.

– Finally, I see an increased demand for personalized learning. This trend means that learning is tailored to individual needs and learning styles, leading to a growing demand for personalized learning solutions and microlearning. My absolute guess is that this development will continue. As new technology and AI become more integrated parts of our organizational learning, we can create even more flexible and adaptable learning environments that can reach and engage an even broader workforce.

"As it becomes increasingly business-critical to ensure the right skills, organizations have much to gain by allowing those with expertise in learning and development to shift from taking orders to being more proactive."

*Those who are successful in building learning organizations, what do they do that others should emulate?*

*Those who are successful in building learning organizations, what do they do that others should emulate?*

– Here, I would like to highlight three things that organizations that successfully manage to build learning organizations do a little extra well.

– First and foremost, they understand the importance of **ensuring a clear vision** for the organization. You could describe it as a lighthouse showing the way. Organizations that create a clear vision help everyone in the organization understand the direction they are heading – and what they need to learn to get there.

– In addition, systems support and structures that enable **continuous skills mapping and competence analysis** are crucial for ensuring that the right skills are developed. Through continuous competence mapping and analysis, it becomes possible to work smart with both existing and new skills, as well as facilitate the development and recruitment of the needed skills.

– Last but not least, those who succeed **invest in building a culture that encourages learning** and leadership that enables learning. This is central to ensuring that skill development and learning are constantly present in the organization's everyday life. The top management's clear support and commitment to learning are crucial to creating a culture where learning is prioritized and seen as a strategic investment. The managers' knowledge and understanding of how to lead learning are then crucial to making it happen in the organization's everyday life.********

### *What elements do you think should be included in a learning strategy?** *

*What elements do you think should be included in a learning strategy?*

– A learning strategy can include several different components, depending on the organization's context. If we look at a learning strategy for an L&D team, for example, I would suggest that it includes five main parts:

**1. A clear goal**: It is important to define the overall goal and purpose of the L&D function. What is the team aiming to achieve through its efforts?**2. A clear game plan:** It is crucial to clarify which specific areas and initiatives the L&D function should focus on. Who are the key stakeholders, and what is not expected to be part of the function's responsibilities?**3. A plan for success:** The L&D team should develop a clear plan to ensure that they reach their goals according to the defined game plan. What actions and methods will be used to implement the strategy effectively?**4. Necessary skills:** It is important to identify the skills and competencies required within the L&D team to successfully implement the strategy. Internal skill development within the team is an important aspect to consider.**5. Structures and systems support: **To create the conditions for the L&D team to achieve its goals, the right structures and systems support are necessary.

– By integrating these five parts into the learning strategy, the L&D team can create a solid foundation for promoting the development of the organization's most critical skills and thereby contribute business value.

*How do you perceive the use of AI within Learning & Development today and where do you think we will stand in five years?*

*How do you perceive the use of AI within Learning & Development today and where do you think we will stand in five years?*

– Regarding the use of AI within L&D today, I still think it is primarily used to enhance learning materials, build training content, and streamline administrative processes. Going forward, however, I expect AI to play an even greater role within L&D, with the use of advanced AI algorithms, for example, helping more organizations predict and tailor learning needs more extensively. AI can also be used to create more realistic and interactive simulation exercises and learning experiences that better meet individual and organizational needs. Only when AI is used in this way will we be able to utilize the technology to innovate learning to achieve better effectiveness and greater business value.

*What are the most common questions you get from your clients?*

*What are the most common questions you get from your clients?*

– Right now, there is a major focus on **skills mapping** among our clients. Due to market conditions, budgets for skill development have decreased, and more are becoming aware of the valuable role skills mapping can play as a tool to ensure the right priorities and methods for the development of business-critical skills. This can be seen as proof that we, in tougher times, need to be innovative and adapt our working methods. Although skills mapping is not something new, its importance has increased in times when we must be more economical with both time and resources. Organizations that now take the initiative to develop processes and strategies for continuous skills mapping will be able to benefit from this even when the market recovers and budgets for learning and skill development increase again.

"Many organizations rush forward in skills development work without direction, but to achieve real effects from re- and upskilling efforts, it's necessary to ensure there is agreement on where the organization is headed."

***How would you say the impact of learning initiatives is best measured?*

*How would you say the impact of learning initiatives is best measured?*

– To measure the impact of learning initiatives effectively, I usually rely on a three-step model: "*I KNOW*," "*I CAN*," and "*I DO*." The first level measures participants' understanding after a learning initiative, the second level assesses their ability to apply their knowledge, and the third level measures the actual impact on participants' performance and business results. Using such a model allows organizations to gain a more holistic view of learning's effects and tailor their strategies accordingly.

– The most common method is to measure participants' understanding through quizzes, scenario-based questions, and group discussions. While this is not irrelevant, it doesn't really provide an understanding of the learning initiative's effect on participants' performance. To succeed in this, one needs to measure the initiative through real application, result analysis, and comparisons of how work was performed before and after the learning initiative. This is not always simple, but to truly understand the actual impact of a learning initiative, one must reach this level, and for a comprehensive understanding, it is preferable to include measurements that cover all three levels.


*According to the World Economic Forum (2024), the most promising strategy for achieving business goals over the next five years is to focus on upskilling and reskilling employees. For those who have not yet realized this and are just starting, where should they begin?*

*According to the World Economic Forum (2024), the most promising strategy for achieving business goals over the next five years is to focus on upskilling and reskilling employees. For those who have not yet realized this and are just starting, where should they begin?*

– For organizations that are just starting, I would recommend beginning by ensuring there is a **clear vision and direction** for the organization. For example, if it's an organization in the automotive industry, it could involve setting goals like "X% of our cars will be fully electric by 2030." Without clarity around the organization's vision and direction, it becomes difficult to build the skills required for continued growth and development. One of my favorite quotes, from "Alice in Wonderland," illustrates this well: "*If you don't know where you are going, any road will take you there.*" Many organizations rush forward in skills development work without direction, but to achieve real effects from re- and upskilling efforts, it's necessary to ensure there is agreement on where the organization is headed.

– Secondly, **needs analysis** is a critical part of the process. Once the overall direction is established, it becomes crucial to analyze which skills are needed to take the organization in this direction. By mapping skills needs and competency gaps, one can identify the risks and opportunities various types of reskill and upskill efforts pose for the organization.

– Finally, it is essential to** create a learning culture**. By building an environment where learning is prioritized and encouraged, one creates conditions for employees to continuously develop their skills and competencies. It is important to involve managers and give them the tools and support they need to lead learning and development in daily life. This is crucial for the organization to maximize the benefits of its investments in skills development.
