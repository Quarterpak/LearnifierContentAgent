## 1. **Increased attractiveness in a competitive market**

According to BambooHR, **70% of new hires decide whether a job is right for them within the first month**, and nearly 30% make that decision in just one week. In fact, 20% of new employees quit within their first 45 days. These numbers highlight the importance of effective onboarding, especially in the wake of the "Great Resignation" that reshaped talent expectations globally.

By offering clear career paths and meaningful learning opportunities, particularly through digital tools, you improve retention, improve early performance, and stand out in a crowded job market.

## 2. **Higher engagement across the organization**

Engagement is closely tied to performance. With a digital learning platform, it becomes easier to upskill employees, partners, and customers alike. The ability to share knowledge efficiently fuels a culture of learning, increases motivation, and strengthens your company from the inside out.

## 3. **Better ROI through smarter onboarding**

Structured onboarding programs help new hires reach full productivity up to **34% faster**, according to research from Brandon Hall Group. Companies that begin onboarding before day one are **83% more likely** to see stronger engagement, and **58% more likely** to retain employees for three years or longer. But none of this matters unless your onboarding meets the expectations of today's workforce.

## 4. **Stronger fexibility and adaptability**

The skills needed today won’t be the same tomorrow. The World Economic Forum reports that **half of all employees will require reskilling by 2030**, with tech transformation, AI, and sustainability among the key drivers. Whether it's onboarding, internal product training, or external customer education, digital learning gives you the agility to meet new demands quickly and at scale.

## 5. **Greater productivity and innovation**

Digital transformation has reshaped how we work, and that includes how we learn. Modern teams thrive on a mix of formal and informal learning, supported by the right tools and a culture of continuous improvement. To build future-ready teams, it’s not enough to hire the right people, you also need to develop the talent you already have.
