**Implementing a digital learning platform**


It all started during the pandemic when the need for flexible and digital solutions became urgent. MIAB decided to implement a digital learning platform to ensure that all employees could receive the same level of training, regardless of their location in the country.

“We realized it was difficult to gather everyone for classroom training, especially since we have so many employees across Sweden,” Anna says. “With digital courses, our employees can learn at their own pace or revisit courses to, for example, rewatch an instructional video.”

**Engaging preboarding and onboarding**


Particular focus has been placed on onboarding to create a welcoming and effective start for new employees. MIAB has developed a two-part process that combines preboarding and onboarding. “We start with a short preboarding where new employees are introduced to the company, our history, and our values,” Anna explains. “Then follows a more comprehensive onboarding program that includes everything from system overviews to ergonomics and safety.”

**Leadership training and development**


MIAB has also developed specific leadership training programs for team leaders and group leaders, using a combination of digital content and physical meetings. “It’s important for us that our leaders not only gain knowledge but also have a platform to discuss and develop together,” Anna says.

**Scalable training driving impactful results**


One of the biggest successes of the new training model is its scalability. MIAB now has over 4,000 employees, and with the help of digital tools, they can ensure that everyone receives the same high standard of training. “I’m so proud that we can reach so many and that we actually see the difference in the quality of the work,” Anna says. “It’s also fantastic to hear from employees that they appreciate the training programs.”

**Scaling digital training for the future**


Anna looks forward to further developing MIAB’s training programs in Learnifier, including adding more automation and customized courses for different roles. “We’re just at the beginning of our journey, but we’re already seeing the difference it makes for both employees and customers,” Anna concludes.
