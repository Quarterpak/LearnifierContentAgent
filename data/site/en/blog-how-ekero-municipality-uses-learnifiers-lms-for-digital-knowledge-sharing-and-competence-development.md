**Creating a culture of knowledge sharing and learning**

It all started with a vision — *Next Ekerö*. Like many other municipalities, Ekerö faces challenges in attracting and retaining skilled personnel, particularly in fields such as healthcare and education. By investing in digital tools and services, the municipality aimed to create a smarter work environment while making learning simple, flexible, and fun.

Employees were not only expected to participate in formal courses but were also encouraged to be curious and to try new things. The goal was to create a culture where knowledge sharing and learning were a natural part of the workday.

**The learning portal – A key to success**

In January 2019, Ekerö Municipality implemented Learnifier as its learning platform, which quickly proved to be a crucial tool in their journey toward digital competence development. When the pandemic struck a few months later, many employees were forced to work remotely, and the need for flexible learning tools became urgent.

In a short time, the municipality developed a wide range of digital courses to support employees in working efficiently from home. Within just three months, 20 courses were created, providing staff with the skills they needed to use tools like Microsoft 365 and Teams.

**Onboarding program for new employees**

Ekerö Municipality has also developed a comprehensive onboarding program for new employees, where digital courses are combined with physical activities. The program consists of three parts: Welcome to Ekerö Municipality, Digital Workplace, and Information Security. These courses are mandatory for all new employees and are designed to quickly equip them with the tools they need to be effective in their new roles.

In addition to the courses, new employees are invited to a guided bus tour through the municipality, where they learn more about Ekerö’s history, future plans, and visit various departments.

"We don’t know what competencies we will need tomorrow, but by fostering curiosity and continuous learning, we are ready to meet the challenges of the future."

**Automating onboarding and training processes**

To streamline skills development, Ekerö Municipality will focus on automating several processes. Currently, the HR department is responsible for tracking and reminding new employees about introductory courses. The plan moving forward is to automate the distribution of courses to new employees as soon as they receive an email address. This will reduce the administrative burden and make it easier for the HR department to ensure that everyone completes their introductory courses.

**Continuous learning**

For Ekerö Municipality, the future is about creating a culture where learning is a continuous process. With a range of courses covering everything from work environment and leadership to specific tools, employees are given the opportunity to grow and develop in their roles.

As Katarina Hellander Burvall, digitalization strategist at Ekerö Municipality, puts it: "We don’t know what competencies we will need tomorrow, but by fostering curiosity and continuous learning, we are ready to meet the challenges of the future."
