Helena explains that the company culture is further enhanced by investing in leadership training for key personnel. Additionally, team-building activities, such as celebrating achievements together and regularly gathering to foster team spirit and engagement, are prioritized.

“We want everyone to feel secure here, and we believe a familial feeling is best created when we have our own staff instead of temporary hires,” says Helena. “Trust is the foundation of all learning – without it, it’s hard to grow.”
