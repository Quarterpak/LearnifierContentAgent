These guiding beliefs shape everything we do - from how we build our product to how we work as a team.

We are passionate about learning and absolutely love being part of the tech revolution that is changing how, when, and from whom we learn – even how we think of learning. As technology is growing exponentially it’s getting tougher to foresee which jobs and competence are needed.

Learnability and agility are key “skills”. This gets us even more excited about our ambition: to change the way companies learn and develop – and deliver a powerful tool that empowers people to learn, share, and create.

We believe that the best way to learn is to teach. And that’s why collaboration, sharing, and interaction is such a big part of what we’ve built.

We know from research that Learning-by-teaching just gives better understanding and knowledge retention. On top, it is through dialogue we are all challenged in the way we think and actively use what we learned. Basically, we want all learning organizations to embrace learnability and enjoy tools that easily make anyone become “instructor” or trainer.

We absolutely love to make complex stuff simple. More specifically; simple in powerful way. Trust us on this when we say; it is not as easy as it sounds – or looks for that matter. As much as that makes us a proud agile team, we don’t stop there.

We are constantly pushing our ideas and adjusting our product roadmap together with the best partners in the world: Our customers. We believe that the more we blend vision with practice, the better solutions we create.

In this tech world of gadgets, apps, and digitization, face-to-face interaction means the world to many. Yes, AI and AR are bedazzling. We too love the “smartness” of things. But as complexity rises, we see the human factor playing a great role. It has an immense effect on engagement.

Keep in mind that employees with 25 or more friends at work feel 69% more engaged. So, while the mobile phone is used the least to actually call somebody, we are here to enable real-life learning session and blended learning.

Learning is what makes us grow. I believe that in order to lead a happy life growth is key. I want to grow, I want our team to grow, and I want to see you grow. Our mission is to create a nifty little software tool - with all the complexities contained within - that helps you and people around you grow. When you start working with us I promise you that growth will happen by transforming the way you learn.

**Live, learn, lead**Learnifier is a tech company built on a human-first approach, and we want to provide a first-class learning journey. To help us achieve our everyday goals, we base our work on the following:

**LIVE**We take responsibility for our well-being and are also attentive and caring about others’ well-being. Our ambition is to become ten times better, both as a person and professionally, on this journey.

**LEARN**We adopt a growth mindset and challenge each other to accept the fear that comes with change as excitement. We embrace the fact that failure is an inevitable part of learning.

**LEAD**We always act as leaders, at least of ourselves. We take responsibility for finding and communicating our goals, motivations, and needs. To us, leadership is not a role but a responsibility we choose to take on.
