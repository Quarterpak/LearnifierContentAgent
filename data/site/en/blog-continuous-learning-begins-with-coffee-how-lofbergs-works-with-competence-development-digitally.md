Löfbergs is a leading company that goes the extra mile. They get coffee from 25 countries, visit the growers' plantations, and are big on Fairtrade. Making ten million cups every day, they set high standards for themselves.

– Connecting directly with coffee farmers guarantees diverse flavors and promotes global sustainability and fair working conditions. We value sustainable production and organizational growth. To achieve this, we prioritize staff training, both in-person and digitally, HR manager Helena Eriksson explains.

**An inspiring hub for knowledge and discovery**

Löfbergs utilizes Learnifier as the organization learning platform. The courses cover both mandatory and optional subjects, spanning from food safety and business ethics to coffee expertise and system guides. Helena values the accessibility of education for all who are interested.

– We prioritize employee needs and regularly enhance our courses. For instance, a brief film illustrating efficient navigation through our organization chart has proven highly effective. It's the small yet crucial improvements that boost overall business efficiency.

"As a manager, being able to see and measure how far the course participants have come and where extra efforts are needed is invaluable."

**Tailored onboarding and knowledge measurement**


The learning platform has significantly impacted Löfbergs, especially in the crucial area of onboarding. The company prioritizes the swift integration of new employees and has streamlined this process effectively through Learnifier.

– Upon contract signing, new hires receive an automated welcome email and engage in digital pre-boarding for essential company details. The first week includes comprehensive onboarding, followed by tailored courses and role-specific training.

The mandatory courses in hygiene and food safety are also crucial for the company. The integration between Learnifier and the internal skills module allows managers to easily get a comprehensive overview of each employee’s progress.

– As a manager, being able to see and measure how far the course participants have come and where extra efforts are needed is invaluable.

**A transparent leadership program**

Löfbergs lives by the motto that safe leaders create safe employees. Helena has therefore been involved in developing a solid leadership program consisting of four different modules where they work with self-awareness, team development, conflict management, and the company’s business.

– The leadership program blends physical activities with the efficiency of our digital platform. By consolidating crucial documents and information in one accessible space, it enables seamless involvement from management at all levels. This fosters security, smooth operations, and transparency in our business.

Today, the HR department builds most of the course offerings directly in Learnifier, but the expertise behind the content is gathered from across the organization.

– We aim for increased departmental involvement in building the course catalog. An open invitation fosters a growing desire for learning, and a wealth of knowledge awaits discovery. All it takes is the initiative to unearth it, Helena Eriksson concludes.
