Lisa Lövedal, coordinator at EKTK, has been a key figure in building the company’s internal training portal. In an interview, she shares the process, challenges, and what has made them succeed in getting started so quickly.

## The Challenge: Distributed Teams and Difficulties with Traditional Training

EKTK works with power assembly and electrical power solutions, often in large industrial projects. With installers and technicians spread across the country, from southern Sweden to Boden, it was difficult to gather everyone for physical training sessions.

Previously, the company primarily focused on external certification training, but internal skills development had been lacking.

*“We wanted to be able to tailor training to our own needs, such as information security and project management, and give everyone access to the right knowledge at the right time,”* says Lisa.

It was also clear that the old model, where all training depended on an in-person instructor, was not sustainable.

*“We haven’t worked with internal training to a large extent before, mainly because it has been hard to bring everyone together. It has mostly been the training required by law, and those were booked externally. But we wanted to have more control ourselves,” *says Lisa.

## The Solution: A Digital Training Platform Through Learnifier

“We immediately liked how easy it was to create courses, edit videos, and add interactive elements. It allows us to create professional content without being training experts”

To make training more accessible for everyone at EKTK, they decided to invest in a digital learning platform through Learnifier. Lisa and her colleague Linda, the company’s controller, began building courses focusing on:

**Introduction training**– customized for both installers and office staff**KMA training**– focusing on quality, environment, and occupational health and safety**Information security**– an important part of their ISO work

They quickly found that the platform was both easy to use and powerful in its features.

*“We immediately liked how easy it was to create courses, edit videos, and add interactive elements. It allows us to create professional content without being training experts,”* says Lisa.

Being able to mix different media has also been a key factor.

*“We really love the video editing tool! We record clips of ourselves, do screen recordings, and add audio afterward – and it looks really good and is easy to absorb,”* she explains.

Another benefit has been the built-in features to track participants’ progress.

*“We can set rules for reminders and get a clear overview of who has completed the courses. It makes it easy to ensure everyone gets the information they need,” *says Lisa.

## Success factors

EKTK’s fast implementation of digital training is due to several factors:

**Technical experience and structure**– both Lisa and Linda had experience with digital tools and could quickly navigate the platform.**Simplicity of Learnifier**– “It’s so user-friendly that we got started quickly and were able to start building training without any hassle,” says Lisa.**Flexibility and accessibility**– “Now, our installers can take the courses when they have time, instead of us trying to coordinate physical meetings,” she says.**Reminder features**– “It saves us a lot of administrative time for the system to remind those who haven’t completed a course,” she explains.


**Next Steps and Future Plans**

EKTK sees the digital training platform as a long-term investment and has already identified several areas where they want to develop new courses.

*“There will be new courses all the time. We already have a list of what we want to build next,” *says Lisa.

The next item on the agenda is more training related to the company’s digitalization and internal systems.

*“We are digitalizing more parts of the business, so we see a need to train in our different systems. For example, purchasing, tool management, and record-keeping. There’s a lot of information to convey, and we see that short digital courses are an efficient way to do it,”* she explains.

Another important aspect is to create training tailored for specific job roles.

*“We started with a general onboarding course but quickly realized we needed to break it into parts. Now, we have separate introduction courses for installers and office staff, and we see the need for more role-specific training going forward,” *says Lisa.

Lisa Lövedal and her colleague Linda Fjärrstrand also plan to involve more people from the company in the development of the training programs.

*“Until now, we’ve done much of it ourselves, but we see that we need to bring in more with specialized knowledge, such as project managers, to create more in-depth courses,” *says Lisa.

They have already started testing their courses and look forward to launching more to the entire organization.

*“Now it will be exciting to see how the courses are received by the installers, because we know it can be a challenge to get everyone to prioritize digital training,” *says Lisa.

“The biggest gain is that we can now reach everyone, no matter where they are. The training is available when and where it suits them. It’s a huge difference compared to how we worked before”


**Conclusion: An Investment in Both Quality and Efficiency**

EKTK’s digital training journey has not only increased access to important knowledge but also streamlined the entire learning process. Eliminating long travels and physical training sessions saves both time and money – while allowing all employees to develop on their own terms.

*“The biggest gain is that we can now reach everyone, no matter where they are. The training is available when and where it suits them. It’s a huge difference compared to how we worked before,”* concludes Lisa.

And this is just the beginning.

*“There will be many more courses in the future, and we can already see the difference it makes for our organization,” *she says.
