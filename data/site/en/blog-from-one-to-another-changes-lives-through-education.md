“Many people think I’ve taught the women down there something, but the truth is I’ve learned more from them. They’ve shown me what happiness is and how to truly care for each other.”

Kristina Hagström Ilievska had long wanted to make a difference in vulnerable and impoverished countries but realized that good intentions weren’t enough. She wanted to see, explore, and truly experience the reality many speak of but few have actually lived. During a visit to Kenya in 2011, she began reaching out to women in the surrounding villages.

“At first, I failed to connect and felt deeply discouraged. But one day, I heard a group of women laughing and singing together. In that moment, I realized the problem was me—I needed to start asking the right questions and understand their actual needs,” Kristina tells Learnifier.

That experience not only changed her perspective but became the catalyst for something bigger. Alongside local leaders and support networks, Kristina and her co-founders Elif Schmidt and Louise Felldin began building a program focused on empowering women through education and community. A few years later, the organization From One to Another was born.

**Hope sparks hope**

Today, thousands of lives have been improved thanks to From One to Another and their *Circle of Education* concept. It’s based on the idea that education and support ripple outward—from one individual to another—transforming entire communities. The Circle of Education includes coach training, networking for women, scholarship support, and tools for self-sufficiency and independence.

“Local women are trained to become coaches and serve as leaders in their villages. They gain knowledge in health, economics, entrepreneurship, and education,” Kristina explains.

The coaches then train other women in the villages for two hours each week. These sessions cover essential skills like reading and writing, as well as practical topics like money management, running small businesses, and improving health.

“If a woman learns to write her name, she can get an ID card, open a bank account, and start taking control of her life.”

**Education as a guiding light**

Women participating in the program gain access to microloans to start small businesses. By learning how to grow, sell, and think strategically about their resources, they’re able to support their families and build better futures.

“We work to create confident mothers who can stand up for their daughters and give them access to education. That’s where real change begins.”

Girls are given the opportunity to attend school through scholarships that cover 50–90% of tuition. To encourage commitment, families are expected to contribute the remaining amount.

“Education is a force that helps people make better choices. That’s true everywhere in the world—whether you live in Trump Land or rural Kenya.”

One of the organization’s most powerful success stories is Margaret, a woman who was thrown out of her home with her four children. With support from From One to Another, she was able to get an education, start a farm, and begin selling goods at the market. Two of her daughters received scholarships to complete their education, and today they help support the family financially.

“Margaret’s story shows that it’s possible to change lives—not just for one person, but for an entire family and a whole community,” Kristina continues.

**A partnership for learning**

From One to Another uses Learnifier’s platform to onboard new volunteers into their work. A clear onboarding process is essential to the organization, and the platform is also used to develop materials for both volunteers and local coaches.

“Learnifier allows us to reach more people, even when conditions on the ground are challenging. Plus, we’ve noticed we save a lot of time using Learnifier. Previously, onboarding a new volunteer took about 10 hours. Now, we’ve streamlined the process to just 3 hours—a 70% improvement—and the volunteer is ready to contribute right away.”

With a strong local presence in some of the world’s most vulnerable regions, and a long-term vision guiding their efforts, From One to Another is a unique and pioneering organization. But to turn that vision into reality, more than big hearts are needed—financial resources are crucial. That’s why the organization welcomes generous contributions from both individuals and companies.

“A scholarship for a girl’s education costs 2,000 SEK (around $190) and can change her life forever. Every donation matters, big or small.”

**Together for a better future**

When Kristina talks about the organization’s journey, her passion and conviction shine through. She firmly believes the world can become more just and says it’s not about having huge resources—it’s about the willingness to take that first step.

“One of our teachers described it beautifully: From One to Another is like throwing a stone in the water and watching the ripples spread. When we see that effect, we know we’ve succeeded,” she concludes.
