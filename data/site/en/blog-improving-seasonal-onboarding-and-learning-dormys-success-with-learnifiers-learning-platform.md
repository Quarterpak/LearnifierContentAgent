The golf world’s high season runs from March to September, a period of intense months for Dormy, a well-known and successful brand in Sweden. During these months, demand for staff is always high, and the need for recruiting new employees to their many stores across the country increases significantly year after year.

“We recruit about 65 new store employees every year. Most of them join right in the middle of the high season when we are at our busiest. Therefore, it is crucial that we give them the best possible foundation to succeed in their roles from the start” explains Fredrik Nilsson, HR and sustainability specialist at Dormy.

## Focus on sustainable learning


Dormy's challenge has been to introduce new employees in a sustainable and structured way, despite time constraints. Previously, the onboarding process varied between stores, giving employees different starting points. Since 2020, the company has worked to create a clear and unified onboarding process, which has yielded positive results.

“Our employees must quickly adapt to the job to deliver the best possible service to customers. That’s why we’ve implemented a digital learning platform and developed three core training programs: preboarding, product training, and supplier training.”

The preboarding process gives new employees an initial introduction to the company even before their first day on the job. This not only ensures they are better prepared and able to start quickly but also allows them to gain an understanding of Dormy’s values and work culture, helping them feel at home from the beginning. The product training ranges from basic to advanced levels and aims to provide all employees with a solid foundation in golf equipment knowledge.

“We also offer our employees the opportunity to specialize in specific areas, ultimately creating an even better customer experience.”

By combining digital tools with a carefully planned training structure, Dormy has created an onboarding process that not only saves time but also improves outcomes for both employees and customers.

## Digital supplier training


Supplier training has been a crucial success factor for Dormy. Traditionally, this involved suppliers visiting the stores to train the staff. However, during the pandemic, Dormy, like many others, was forced to find alternative solutions.

“Our digital supplier training allowed us to continue our training efforts despite the restrictions. Even after the pandemic, these have proven extremely valuable, as we can now offer training to employees who are unable to attend the in-person sessions.”

## Training programs – a handbook for skills


After implementing the new training programs, Dormy noticed a clear improvement in how well-prepared their employees were, even during high season. The introductory training has evolved into a valued tool used continuously – not only during preboarding but also later as a practical mini-handbook.

“We see that employees often return to the preboarding course to double-check information long after they have started their employment.”

By combining digital tools with a carefully planned training structure, Dormy has created an onboarding process that not only saves time but also improves outcomes for both employees and customers.

“We are very proud of what we have achieved and look forward to continuing to develop our training initiatives to meet future challenges,” concludes Fredrik Nilsson.
