"The basic training from Learnifier was fantastic.We gained a good understanding of the system and could start working quickly.We could build the courses with support from Learnifier during our training, which meant that we had courses to go live with immediately after our onboarding. That was great. Since then we have continued to produce."

”Today we can present Pinchos' wonderful world in a unified and pedagogical way. We have a good solution for the administration of our trainings, have gained the insight that it is extremely good and that we will continue to create relevant content.”
