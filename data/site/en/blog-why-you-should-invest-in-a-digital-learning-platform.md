Research shows that **only 14% of employees in Swedish workplaces feel engaged**. Global numbers aren’t much better. In fact, more and more people are quitting their jobs to try something new, creating major challenges for companies across industries. Every new hire who leaves before delivering results costs both time and money.

### A digital 360° perspective

We know that both preboarding and onboarding have a positive, preventive effect on employee engagement. But your digital learning investment shouldn't stop at a great introduction.

Commitment and job satisfaction are closely linked to continuous professional and personal development. To drive long-term engagement, you need a **modern learning platform** that allows you to tailor content to meet employees’ fast-changing expectations and needs.

With the right digital tool, you can easily create and update courses, information, and training materials based on real-time insights into what works—and what doesn’t. The result? Seamless learning, satisfied users, and faster knowledge transfer.

### Learning that builds stronger bonds

Studies show that **motivated and engaged employees take 40% fewer sick days**. And when you give your entire organization access to a digital learning platform, you unlock potential, increase engagement, and strengthen relationships.

Bringing together participants from all roles and backgrounds to share knowledge in one space not only builds skills and competencies, it also creates deeper connections between your employees and your organization.

By allowing employees to learn at their own pace, from any device, you enable people to stay focused on their jobs while developing new capabilities. It’s a win-win combination that strengthens the bond between you and your team.
