**What is Learning and Development?**


In HR, Learning and Development plays a crucial role in fostering employee growth and ensuring organizational success. L&D involves various methods like online courses, in-person training, and mentorships, aiming to equip employees with the skills necessary for their roles and contribute to the company’s overall progress. While HR oversees general operations, the focus of Learning and Development is specifically on enhancing professional growth and skills. Recognizing these distinctions is vital for your organization’s advancement. Many follow the 70:20:10 rule in Learning and Development, emphasizing the significance of learning from experiences (70%), relationships (20%), and formal training (10%) to create effective learning programs.
